# Making Your First Contribution
An In-Person Workshop at EHC

## Objective
Using Replit multiplayer to work together to add features and content to the EHC.WIKI site. Features that are well liked will be added to the actual site.

### Split into teams
Teams of three will work together using the MVP.CSS documentation, knowledge of CSS, and knowledge of HTML to make changes to the EHC.WIKI site.

### Understanding the Code
When you approach the repl it will have a collection of files on the left. As you edit a specific file it will edit for the rest of the users. The file titled ai.html is used to control the ai page. So on and so forth.
The static folder contains all of the images used. The style.css file includes all of the customized css used, none for the moment. 

** Looking at misc.html **
This is an example page which has the least amount of fluff, making it great for analyzing. The head includes our stylesheets, logo, and metadata. The header includes our navagation bar and main heading on the top of the page.
Hr indicates the beginning of a new section thematically. The combination of section and aside tags directs the MVP.CSS framework to produce a card. The footer has a table within it.

### What kinds of things to add?
Custom CSS rules: https://andybrewer.github.io/mvp/#docs. Scroll to CSS section. Make the background of the page orange because why not?
Add Images: The cards are missing photos. You can add photos to make them whole.
Change Fonts: Google Fonts has a wide selection. Use a wacky font. 
Add JS: P5.JS, ML.JS, Google Teachable Machine, etc.

*Even if you aren't able to do any of those things*
You can still write HTML. Add a new card to one of the pages and include new content such as your favorite programming resource or framework.

This workshop is short in writing. The workshop will be mostly working time. Just hanging out and working on a website.

Thanks, Kyle.
